# ASCII-Sign-Language

This project presents the results of the [Kaggle II competition for IFT6390 Fall 2023 course at Université de Montréal](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ascii-sign-language). The goal of this competition is
to correctly classify two given sign language images into their corresponding alphabet and then sum their respective ASCII values to provide the resultant final character corresponding to the summed ASCII value.

We ask you to build a random forest and a neural network (CNN) classifier and beat the baselines highlighted in the leaderboard. These baselines are:

* a dummy classifier initialized with random parameters.
* a random forest classifier.
* the TA’s best baseline.
  
Besides the methods specified above, we had to compare our results and performance using other models.
